關於冥想，也關於聆聽的提醒：
⁡

>「如果你沉浸在自己的故事裡，就像住在小公寓，只夠容納你自己，跟你的小床墊。」
⁡

>「一旦你和自己的想法之間有些空間，就像搬進一間大房子裡，有空間能邀請別人來。有些空間容納你，也有空間容納他們，那就是寬闊。」

The moment I just accepted where I was, instead of wishing I was somewhere else, 
一旦接受自己所在之處而不是希望能在他處
⁡

everything just got better. 
一切就變好了
⁡

It's like, for a second, my thoughts weren't much of anything. 
像是剎那間，我的想法都歸零了
⁡

If you're caught up in your story, 
如果你沉浸在自己的故事裡
⁡

it's like living in a tiny apartment with just enough room for you 
就像住在小公寓，只夠容納你自己
⁡

and your little mattress. 
跟你的小床墊
⁡

The moment you get a little space between yourself and your thoughts, 
一旦你和自己的想法之間有些空間
⁡

it's like moving into a much bigger house. 
就像搬進一間大房子裡
⁡

Then there's room to invite people in. 
有空間能邀請別人來
⁡

There's space for you. 
有些空間容納你
⁡

And there's space for them. 
也有空間容納他們
⁡

That's spaciousness. 
那就是寬闊
⁡

Basically, we're talking about psychological space.
基本上，這就是心理空間
⁡

And a lot of people teach meditation 
很多人在教冥想時
⁡

as if the goal is to treat your mind like an unruly teenager and make it shut up. 
像是要教人把腦袋當成不守規矩的青少年，叫它閉嘴
⁡

---
It seems more like it's accepting there's this infinite swarm of thoughts 
接受你有無限量的想法
⁡

and that by understanding 
藉由瞭解
⁡

that you're not necessarily as connected to them as you thought, it allows-- 
你不如想像中跟那些想法連結那麼深，這能
⁡

Yeah. You don't have to kind of grasp and dwell on that 
你不必緊抓住那個想法
⁡

as the only solution for continuing to be alive. 
把它當作活下去唯一的方法
⁡

-There's another option, 
有另一種選擇

which is to use the sense-percept to arrive back at the present. 
就是用感知到的物體回到當下
